# Researching External APIs Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. When you read back the work, you've written things clearly so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that uses a third-party API.

The app should be a simple idea, as the goal is to research and determine if an API is appropriate for your API.

Choose one of the following categories and APIs

- Music: [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
- Movies: [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com)
- Text Translator: [Rapid Translate](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up?referral=/sibaridev/api/rapid-translate-multi-traduction)
- Sports: [Sports Score](https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/sportscore1)
- City Info: [311 Call Aggregator](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?Dataset-Information_Agency=311)
- Art : [Metropolitan Museum of Art ](https://metmuseum.github.io)

Based on these categories. Choose an app idea and write several user stories below.

> As a user ...

> As a user ...

> As a user ...

- Determine what data is necessary to build your app

> The data I need for my app is ...

- Determine if your API has the data you want available

> The data has the following fields that DO/DO NOT fulfill my app requirements

> Here are some sample fields I can get back:

- Determine the number of free requests you can make

> The number of free requests I can make is...

- Determine if this number is reasonable for you to develop your application in a timely manner

> The number of free requests WOULD/WOULD NOT be sufficient for me to develop a basic version of the app in a week.

- Determine if this number is reasonable for your users (for now, what if friends and family used your app about once a day)

> The number of free requests WOULD/WOULD NOT be sufficient for my friends and family to use this app daily for one month.

- Determine if you need to enter a credit card

> A credit card is ...

Write one GET request to your chosen API with Postman. This may involve requesting an API key or other steps. If you requested an API Key, please don't include it. Instead, replace that part of the URL WITH `<MY API KEY>.`

> URL

> Include a snippet of sample data

```

```

> **Note**: If you could not get an API key for any reason (like it required a credit card or took too long for an API key to be delivered), just leave a note here and do your best to answer the questions anyway.

What file do you need to store an API key safely?

> The filename is typically ...

> Why do you need git to ignore the file?
